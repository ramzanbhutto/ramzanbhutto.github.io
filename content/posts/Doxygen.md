## ðŸ”¹ What is Doxygen?

[Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) is a documentation generator tool that:
- Parses your code (C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, and many other languages).
- Extracts specially formatted comments.
- Automatically generates documentation in multiple formats:
  - **HTML** (viewable in any browser)
  - **PDF / LaTeX**
  - **Man pages**
  - **Graphs and diagrams** (with Graphviz)

Itâ€™s like having a personal technical writer who works directly from your source code.

---

## ðŸ”¹ What is a Doxyfile?

The `Doxyfile` is the **configuration file** Doxygen uses to determine:
- Which files to document
- Which languages to parse
- Whether to generate graphs or UML diagrams
- What output format to use (HTML, PDF, etc.)

You can generate a default `Doxyfile` with:

```bash
doxygen -g
```
This creates a `Doxyfile` in your current directory, which you can then edit to customize your documentation.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why Use PlantUML and Graphviz with Doxygen?
While Doxygen can generate basic diagrams, integrating **PlantUML** and **Graphviz** allows you to create **more complex and visually appealing diagrams**.
- **PlantUML** lets you create UML diagrams using a simple text-based syntax.
- **Graphviz** generates graphs and diagrams from DOT files, which Doxygen can produce.
 This combination enhances your documentation with:
- Class diagrams
- Sequence diagrams
- State diagrams
- Call graphs 
- Collaboration diagrams

## ðŸ”¹ Installing Doxygen, PlantUML and Graphviz
### Step 1: Install doxygen
 - Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt-get install doxygen
```
 - Arch Linux
```bash
sudo pacman -S doxygen 
```

### Step 2: Install Graphviz
- Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt-get install graphviz 
```
- Arch Linux
```bash
sudo pacman -S graphviz 
```

### Step 3: Install PlantUML
PlantUML requires Java to run. Make sure you have Java installed, then install PlantUML: 
- Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt-get install plantuml 
```
- Arch Linux
```bash
sudo pacman -S plantuml 
```

## ðŸ”¹ Why Write and Configure Your Own Doxyfile?

When you run:

```bash
doxygen -g
```
After running this, Doxygen generates a default Doxyfile with nearly 3000 lines of configuration.While it contains every possible option, it can be overwhelming and cluttered, especially for beginners. It includes many settings that you may never use, making it hard to find the options you actually need.
By writing your own Doxyfile from scratch, you can:
- **Keep it clean and simple**: Only include the settings you actually need.
- **Understand each option**: Learn what each configuration does, making it easier to customize later.
- **Tailor it to your project**: Focus on the specific features and outputs that matter to you.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Understanding Doxyfile configuration
Now, letâ€™s go through each important section of a Doxyfile step-by-step.
First, create a new file named `Doxyfile` in your project directory and open it in your favorite text editor.

### 1. Project Information
The first section defines basic metadata about your project.
```bash
PROJECT_NAME           = "MyProject"
PROJECT_BRIEF          = "A brief description of MyProject"
PROJECT_LOGO           = "path/to/logo.png"
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = docs
```
- `PROJECT_NAME`: The name of your project.
- `PROJECT_BRIEF`: A short description of your project.
- `PROJECT_LOGO`: Path to a logo image to include in the documentation.
- `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`: Where the generated documentation will be saved.

### 2. Input Sources
This section specifies which files and directories to include in the documentation.
```bash
INPUT                  = .
FILE_PATTERNS          = *.cpp *.h *.py 
RECURSIVE              = YES
```
- `INPUT`: The directories or files to scan for documentation.
- `FILE_PATTERNS`: File extensions as per language used in the project.
- `RECURSIVE`: If set to `YES`, Doxygen will search subdirectories. If `NO`, it will only scan the root directory.

### 3. Build Options
This section controls how Doxygen processes the input files.
```bash
EXTRACT_ALL            = YES
EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = YES
EXTRACT_STATIC         = YES
EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES  = YES
EXTRACT_LOCAL_METHODS  = YES
```
- `EXTRACT_ALL`: If `YES`, Doxygen will document all entities, even those without comments.
- `EXTRACT_PRIVATE`: If `YES`, private class members will be included in the documentation.
- `EXTRACT_STATIC`: If `YES`, static members will be documented.
- `EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES`: If `YES`, local classes (defined within functions) will be documented.
- `EXTRACT_LOCAL_METHODS`: If `YES`, local methods (defined within functions) will be documented.

### 4. Output Formats
This section specifies which output formats to generate.
```bash
GENERATE_HTML          = YES
GENERATE_LATEX         = NO 
```
- `GENERATE_HTML`: If `YES`, Doxygen will generate HTML documentation.
- `GENERATE_LATEX`: If `YES`, Doxygen will generate LaTeX documentation (useful for creating PDFs). 

### 5. Graphs and Diagrams
This section enables the generation of graphs and diagrams using Graphviz and PlantUML.
```bash
HAVE_DOT               = YES
DOT_PATH              = 
DOT_IMAGE_FORMAT       = svg
CALL_GRAPH             = YES
CALLER_GRAPH           = YES
CLASS_DIAGRAMS        = YES
UML_LOOK               = YES
DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES = 50
INTERACTIVE_SVG     = YES
```
- `HAVE_DOT`: If `YES`, enables Graphviz support for generating graphs.
- `DOT_PATH`: Path to the Graphviz `dot` executable (if not in your system PATH).
- `DOT_IMAGE_FORMAT`: The format for generated graph images (e.g., `svg`, `png`).
- `CALL_GRAPH`: If `YES`, generates call graphs for functions.
- `CALLER_GRAPH`: If `YES`, generates caller graphs for functions.
- `CLASS_DIAGRAMS`: If `YES`, generates class diagrams.
- `UML_LOOK`: If `YES`, uses a UML-like style for class diagrams.
- `DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES`: Limits the number of nodes in generated graphs to avoid clutter.
- `INTERACTIVE_SVG`: If `YES`, generates interactive SVG diagrams(zoomable and pannable).

 > Tip : If your graphs are too cluttered, try reducing `DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES` or simplifying your code structure.

### 6. PlantUML Integration
To integrate PlantUML, you need to specify the path to the PlantUML jar file.
```bash
PLANTUML_JAR_PATH     = /path/to/plantuml.jar
```
- `PLANTUML_JAR_PATH`: Path to the PlantUML jar file. This allows Doxygen to generate UML diagrams using PlantUML.

### 7. Complete Doxyfile Example
Hereâ€™s a complete example of a simple Doxyfile with the above configurations:
```bash
# --- Project Information ---
PROJECT_NAME           = "MyProject"
PROJECT_BRIEF          = "A brief description of MyProject"
PROJECT_LOGO           = "path/to/logo.png"
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = docs

# --- Input Sources ---
INPUT                  = .
FILE_PATTERNS          = *.cpp *.h *.hpp *.py *.java *.js *.ts *.go *.cs
RECURSIVE              = YES

# --- Build Options ---
EXTRACT_ALL            = YES
EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = YES
EXTRACT_STATIC         = YES
EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES  = YES
EXTRACT_LOCAL_METHODS  = YES

# --- Documentation Output ---
GENERATE_HTML          = YES
GENERATE_LATEX         = NO

# --- Diagrams & Graphs ---
HAVE_DOT               = YES
DOT_PATH              = 
DOT_IMAGE_FORMAT       = svg
CALL_GRAPH             = YES
CALLER_GRAPH           = YES
CLASS_DIAGRAMS        = YES
UML_LOOK               = YES
DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES = 50
INTERACTIVE_SVG     = YES


# --- PlantUML Integration ---
PLANTUML_JAR_PATH      = /path/to/plantuml.jar

```

### 7. Running Doxygen 
Once your Doxyfile is configured, you can generate the documentation by running in your terminal:
```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```
Then, open the generated HTML documentation in your web browser:
```bash
xdg-open docs/html/index.html  # Linux
```
```bash
open docs/html/index.html       # macOS
```
```bash
start docs\html\index.html      # Windows
```
> It will open the main page of your generated documentation, there you can navigate through classes, files, and diagrams. Following is the sample output of the documentation:

## ðŸ”¹ Conclusion
Using Doxygen with PlantUML and Graphviz allows you to create **comprehensive, visually appealing documentation** for your projects with minimal effort. By writing a clean and tailored Doxyfile, you can ensure that your documentation meets your specific needs and showcases your code effectively. It can save you time, improve code maintainability, and enhance collaboration within your team.
>**In short:** Well-documented projects are easier to **maintain**, **scale**, and **share**.  
> If you want your code to speak for itself, **Doxygen is one of the best investments you can make**.
